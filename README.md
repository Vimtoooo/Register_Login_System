# The Register Login System

## Introduction:

I have implemented a basic login system with basic encryption and user validation, while manipulating with object oriented programming features to re-enforce and organize the code effectively.

## Environment:

* **UV**: The UV virtual environment is integrated within this repository, not only facilitating installation of packages, but to organize all files and scripts.

### Files:

* `Login_System.py`: Contains all of the registration login system logic for incorporating with all necessary functionalities for handling a simulation of an actual system implemented in Python.
* `Exceptions.py`: Pursues all custom-made exceptions for clarifying the legibility of error-handling for easy fixes and user-friendly messages, highlighting what went wrong.
* `main.py`: Where the main code execution will begin, creating instances for usability and testing methods in any given situation.

#### Methods:
